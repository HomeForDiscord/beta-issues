# HFD Beta Issues
During the HFD Beta phase we will be tracking issues using this repository. On official release we will be moving issue tracking into the application.

## Fixing Bugs

When a bug is identified it it marked as `Triage` and added to the [HFD](https://github.com/orgs/HomeForDiscord/projects/2) project. Once added to the project we will give it a priority and get to work on fixing it once we get to it.
